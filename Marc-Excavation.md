# MARC Excavations
## Disaster Maps
### March 6th 2019

I started digging the MARC record with a very literal digging. I looked inside the folder of corpora we were using for the example (animals) and decided to search for [the dinosaurs list](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/animals/dinosaurs.json). I excavated the Visual Materials and then the Maps. I feel like Maps are one of the first visualizations system made and I love seeing how they interpret the actual territory of a place. Also what kind of legends and visual code they use. This first excavation wasn't very useful, I realized the list of dinosaurs was too large so the code was running very slowly. Also, the most recurrent found word was 'dinosaur', 'fossils' and 'mammals'. So I went back to the JSON and deleted those that weren't actually a dinosaur species, which I wanted to find. The only map object with a species of dinosaur was a Khaan. Which was still something cool to find. I felt like Archeologist. With the 'cleaned' version of the JSON file I run the code again, it was taking even more to find things and I stopped it before I got any results.

At this point I decided that I should be looking for a smaller list of things to get more and faster results. In my stream of consciousness and remembering about our fellow dinosaurs, I remembered why they disappeared. And that led me to think about natural disasters. These kind of phenomena weren't such a big deal when I was growing up, until 2010 when I experienced the first big earthquake in my country (8.8 in the Richter scale) followed by a Tsunami that destroyed many coastal towns.

After this year, I'm not sure if my awareness of natural disasters grew bigger or the amount of natural disasters worldwide has increased. Many big earthquakes and tsunamis followed from that year (Japan, Haiti China) and hurricanes and floods were a daily news. So I asked myself, how are does these natural disasters appear in the Library of Congress. And specially, are they mapped in some way? Are there maps that
